# (Google) Edit Distance

The edit distance between two strings refers to the minimum number of character 
insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to change one string to the other.
Given two strings, compute the edit distance between them.

For example, the edit distance between “kitten” and “sitting” is three:

1. substitute the “k” for “s”;
2. substitute the “e” for “i”;
3. and append a “g”.
